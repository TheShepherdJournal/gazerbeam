<p>Dear Elijah,</p>
<p>Today we hunted zombies and, I think at some point, goombas. Our hunt took us four blocks south of our house to a village which was surrounded by zombies. We were armed only with a classic phaser from the Star Trek episode “The Cage,” and a small nerf pistol. The village was occupied by a number of villagers who kept us company. I was able to trade with one of the villagers. You told me that I was wearing “pajama armor.” I then said that I had traded with a villager for diamond armor, but you said that this couldn’t happen.</p>
<p>We were able to obtain food from a fridge located at the top of a tower inside the village. I grabbed a banana out of the fridge, and then you grabbed bread. You then said that we would use the bananas and the bread to make “banana bread.” I’m pretty sure that banana bread doesn’t work that way, but this still sounded good.</p>
<p>We didn’t run into very many actual zombies while we were defending the village. Fortunately, a very strong fence had been erected around the perimeter.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to tomorrow when we will no doubt go on another zombie hunt.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Your Dad</p>
