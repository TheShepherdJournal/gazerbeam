<p>I am guessing that this would be right after the first Death Star blew up, and maybe as Darth Vadar’s Tie fighter is spinning out of control, it flies through a rift in space caused by the release of so much energy during the explosion.</p>
<p>Anyways, Darth Vadar is frozen, Buck Rogers style, and preserved until the crew of the Voyager finds his craft floating through space as they are traveling through the Delt Quadrant.<br>
They detected the rift and believe that it is their way home. Thinking that it is an opportunity to communicate with Earth, they transmit the Doctor to the closest computer they can detect in the other universe which happens to be R2D2.</p>
<p>R2D2 projects a hologram of the doctor begging for someone to rescue the crew of the Voyager, but it plays during the medal ceremony following the battle at Yavin and nobody except C3PO sees it. C3PO assumes that it’s just old data which his smaller companion has been storing inside his rusted innards.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Janeway orders that Darth Vadar be revived. Sympathizing with him, Seven of Nine devises a way to replace his bulky armored suit and give him back a normal looking human body made up of cybernetic organs and limbs.</p>
<p>Ensign Kim downloads some records from Skywalker’s Tie Fighter and renders a holographic image of Anakin Skywalker from before he was Darth Vadar. Curious, Kim asks Anakin about his past and grows closer to him, considering him to be almost a friend. Anakin tells him about the Jedi, midichlorians, and the Ways of the Force.</p>
<p>There is tension later when the now former Darth Vadar has a relapse and attacks several red shirts with his lightsaber, then beams down to a nearby lava planet. Violating orders, Seven of Nine beams down after him and after a climactic fight during which he loses his lightsaber she confesses her love for him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the rift between universes has started to grow bigger. Anakin returns to the ship and suggests that he can use the force to close the rift, but he will have to do it from the other side. Anakin and Seven retreat to her cargo bay for a private moment alone, then exchange tearful goodbyes inside the shuttle bay along with everybody else.</p>
<p>Anakin flies through the rift experiencing heavy turbulence then veers close to the opening willing it to close using the force. The effort damages his body and at the last minute an energy wave throws his ship clear. He wakes up in the medical bay of a Star Destroyer, again in his Darth Vadar suit, his Federation/Borg technology having been destroyed or removed.<br>
Darth Vadar later removes his helmet in his pressure chamber revealing that a borg implant is protruding through the skin of his face. Nanoprobes skitter beneath his skin as they work to repair his body.</p>
<p>Before warping away, the Voyager’s sensors detect an Astromech on the surface of the lava planet near where Seven and Anakin had their fight and Harry Kim beams it aboard. Mourning the loss of the Doctor, Torres restores power to the little robot. It immediately jacks into the ship’s computer and suddenly the Doctor appears in Sickbay.</p>
<p>Janeway enters a Captain’s log entry reflecting on their encounter, and stating that things have gotten back to normal over the last few weeks but somehow she feels like it will be a long time before they will be able to forget about Anakin Skywalker.</p>
<p>Cut to Seven suddenly awakening from a recharge cycle inside her alcove, picking up a tricorder and pointing it at her abdomen while it makes scanning noises. She reacts with shock after she sees the results.</p>
<p>In his quarters, Ensign Kim concentrates as he levitates the table in his quarters with his mind. He picks up Darth Vader’s lightsaber and grins towards the camera as ominous music plays, and finally the screen cuts to black.</p>
<p>Then we hear the sound of a man moaning and crying. Lights come on, and we are in a large bedroom. The camera focuses on George Lucas who is sitting up in bed, looking very upset. He reaches for his phone.</p>
<p>“Get me the Headquarters for the Disney Company,” he says. Then, after waiting a few minutes, he says, “This is George. Tell your bosses that I’m accepting their offer to buy Lucasfilm. I’ll sign the paperwork tomorrow.” He hangs up, and then turns the lights off and goes back to sleep.<br>
And, that is how Disney ended up owning the rights to Star Wars.
