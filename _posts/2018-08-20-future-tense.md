<p>I wanted this shot of Elijah looking through the window, both because you can see his reflection in the window, and because that reflection appears blurry. It helped to capture the feeling that Elijah is approaching a major milestone, like starting Kindergarten, and perhaps the reflection in his glass is the developing image of his future self.</p>

<p>While Elijah's reflection could represent a future not yet written, I would almost see it as a representation of the child we will lose as he progresses into Kindergarten and beyond.Â </p>

<p>Actually, what Elijah was asking about were the "Out' and "In" signs on the interior doors. His curiosity about how things worked inside the elementary school helped to cement this sense that Kindergarten will be a life changing experience.</p>
