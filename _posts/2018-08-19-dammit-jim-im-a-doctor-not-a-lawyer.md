It seems that the future of the rebooted “Star Trek” franchise is very uncertain right now. Chris Pine, who has been playing the “young Kirk” in the JJ-Verse movies, has walked away from the part because of a dispute over salary.

I think that Paramount has a much bigger problem on their hands than an actor who requires more money before he will return to the set: thanks to a series of splits and mergers, ownership of Star Trek has become so convoluted to the point of being unmanageable. One party owns the movie rights, and the other owns the TV rights. The reboot movies had to “reimagine” Star Trek in order to get around the parts they don’t own, and then the new series “Discovery” had to re-imagine the TV elements that they don’t own. Basically, this has resulted into new Star Trek programming (either movies or TVs) which looks totally different than what has been done before--simply because of the legality of who owns what.

The only other example of this that I can think of is the way that movies based on Marvel-owned properties have gotten around legal rules about what they could or could not do. For example, “X-Men” movies had mutants, but there are no mention of mutant powers in the “Avenger” movies. The character Quicksilver was a mutant in “X-Men: Days of Future Past,” but in “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” he was an enhanced human. One version has survived, the other didn’t.

In the same way, “Star Trek” properties are building upon the success of previous offerings, but can’t really carry forward the same visual elements. This was never a problem in the recent movies, because all of those stories happen in a parallel timeline--a genius method for getting them around the continuity of the established Star Trek timeline AND the legal requirements. “Star Trek: Discovery” is said to take place in the “Prime” universe, but may actually be a way of resetting everything so that there is only one continuity. The only way to do that is to discard all of the shows from the 1960’s, 1980’s, 1990’s, and 2000’s.

The challenge with the Star Trek franchise is that its roots were planted during a time when audiences and the TV medium were very different from how they are now. “Star Trek” told stories that made you think, and then so did many of the sequel spin-offs. But, as tastes changed, the show tried to adapt by providing more fights, and more sex. The movies tried to up the ante by telling bigger stories than what the television shows ever could. Again, big battles and huge stakes.

The studio is in a conundrum, because no matter what they do with Star Trek, they’re going to lose. They can go “back to basics,” and tell stories like the original series did, but then they will lose some part of their audience. But, if they try to modernize the concept of Star Trek, they run the risk of alienating the long time fans who grew up watching Star Trek shows set in the eras of Kirk, Picard, Sisko, or Janeway.

I think that the studio should focus on making a Star Trek series, and scrap their attempts at making movies. First of all, Star Trek is best suited for the TV medium, where you can take the time to tell smaller, character-driven stories. Focussing on characters helps the audience to understand them better.

As far as when a series should be set, this will undoubtedly be tricky. If you continue from where the TNG-era shows left off, then you will be dealing with baggage from the established timeline as well as, I supposed, the events hinted at during the JJ-verse reboot movies. Still, this is your best bet.

If you set the series during the time before Kirk and Spock, such as when <i>Discovery </i>takes place, then you must also throw out all of the established Star Trek continuity. Disney did something similar when they purchased the rights to “Star Wars,” clearing the slate and allowing them to tell stories their own way. There was also a lot of uproar about this change from fans. It isn’t a perfect solution.

I think that “The Orville” is a perfect model for what a “Star Trek” series could be if set in a time before Kirk and Spock, and if it was presented with a “clean slate.” I noticed that <i>The Orville </i>could basically go anywhere with their storytelling because there are no established rules shaping the rules in their universe. Basically, the ship is a part of an organization that’s basically a lot like the Federation, its mission is to explore the uncharted regions of space, and many of the characters (the humans) are from Earth. The characters are also imperfect and simple enough that they are relatable.

But, didn’t they try that with “Star Trek: Enterprise?” Yes, those characters were flawed, and “down home.” But, the aesthetics of the series were so similar to previous outings, that it was difficult to buy it as a <i>prequel</i>. And, anything that was presented in its proto state--transporters, phasers, photon torpedoes--were quickly upgraded within the context of the story so that they behaved in ways that we were accustomed. The problem with <i>Enterprise</i> was also that the sets and the effects were so much better than from the original series, that this also made it difficult to buy that this was taking place before Kirk and Spock.

The only solution would be to create a show that reboots the entire Star Trek universe, and incorporates the characters from the original series. This is basically what it sounds like <i>Discovery </i>is hoping to do. But, at the same time, you don’t want to reboot too much. Personally, I didn’t like the new look of the Klingons, for example. And there were some aspects of the designs for the other ships that kind of turned me off.

Ultimately, the hope is that studio will not give up on their attempt to tell new Star Trek stories. Because, in the end, we need them now as much as ever.
