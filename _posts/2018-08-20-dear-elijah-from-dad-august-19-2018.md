Dear Elijah,

Today, we recorded our second Minecraft live stream. I gave my gamer tag of “gazerbeam,” and you went by the name of “Elijah.” Our goal was to build three houses and, I think, blow two of them up, maybe. What we ended up doing is building a house that was high up on a precipice, you built a smaller house down lower, and then we both worked together to build an underwater base. We disagreed on the construction of the base. I tried to build an airlock, but you kept getting upset whenever I flooded the inside of our base with water.

After lunch, you and I went on a walk around the Shepherd trail. At first, you didn’t want to walk the entire way, but thanks to a little but of encouragement from me, frequent stops, and a shortcut across the baseball fields, we were able to make it all of the way around. We stopped at the elementary school playground, where I wanted to get a photo of you. You were resistant to the idea of being photographed, and didn’t seem so interested in playing on the playground at first, but then suddenly you saw something you liked and changed your mind. Which was fine to me.

It was a long and arduous walk back home from the elementary school. When we were two blocks away, your battery “ran down,” and you slumped to the ground right in the middle of the sidewalk. I did carry you for a bit, but then you walked for a little ways and we made it home.

You wanted to draw a number line with chalk, so at first I tried to help you but you had trouble getting the numbers right. Then you wanted me to create a hopscotch board, but your mom helped you with that because she knows what that looks like.

You were a little cranky before dinner, so I read you the letter that I had written the night before. You liked it, and immediately wanted to write one of your own. I showed you how you could dictate a message in Google docs, and then spent the next few minutes transcribing a letter addressed to pretty much everybody in your family.

Now, the weekend has come to an end. As I am writing this, you have just one more week of summer vacation before school starts and you are officially a Kindergartener. This was probably the last summer vacation where you didn’t quite understand what having a summer vacation is all about; you’ll probably start to understand pretty quickly, and by the time it is December appreciate your holiday break.

I hope that you enjoy your very last week of summer vacation.

Sincerely,

Your Dad
